# React To-Do App with AWS Amplify

This project demonstrates how to deploy a React-based To-Do application using AWS Amplify. The setup involves AWS services like Amplify Hosting, authentication, and CI/CD to ensure a seamless deployment experience.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn AWS Amplify services.
- Build and deploy a React-based To-Do application.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

AWS Amplify simplifies app development by integrating backend services with a frontend framework. The services utilized include hosting, authentication, and build automation.

## Repository Details

This repository contains:
1. **Source Code**: React app for managing to-do tasks.
2. **AWS Amplify Configuration**: Integration and hosting details.
3. **YAML File**: Build and deployment instructions.

## YAML Configuration

```yaml
defaults:
  version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "Installing dependencies..."
        - npm install --cache .npm --prefer-offline || exit 1  # Ensure installation fails if thereâ€™s an error
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Building the application..."
        - npm run build || exit 1  # Ensure the build fails properly if there's an error
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist  # Vite outputs to 'dist' by default; ensure this matches your Vite config
    files:
      - '**/*'  # Include all files in the output directory
  cache:
    paths:
      - .npm/**/*
      - node_modules/**/*
```

## Deployment Workflow Diagram

### Workflow Diagram:
1. **Code Commit**: Developers push code to the Git repository.
2. **AWS Amplify**: Detects changes and initiates a build.
3. **Pre-Build Phase**: Installs dependencies.
4. **Build Phase**: Builds the React app.
5. **Deployment**: Deploys the build output to Amplify Hosting.

    C --> D[Build Phase: npm run build]
    D --> E[Deploy to Amplify Hosting]
```

### Request Flow:
1. **User**: Interacts with the React app hosted on AWS Amplify.
2. **App**: Sends requests to backend services configured with Amplify.
3. **Amplify**: Handles requests and integrates with other AWS services (e.g., API Gateway, DynamoDB).
